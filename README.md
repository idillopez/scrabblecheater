This code is intended to help Scrabble players strengthen their game by providing the highest point words wherever possible on the board. Once the player runs the code it will ask them to enter the letters they have in their rack and the letters that already are on the board in accordance with their location. Once all input is entered, the code chooses the appropriate word with the highest point possible.

***disclaimer:*** 
The code has been created by 3 linguistics students who have never used phyton or any other programming language before! We did our best however if the code doesn't fulfill expectations, please go easy on us! 
ps: it only functions with maximum 3 letter words at this point, on a 3x3 board.

## How To Play
The game enables single-players only. The main goal for the code is to assist players as a side tool rather than create a wholesome gaming experience. So, the users of the code will not be experiencing the Scrabble Game here. 

Once you run the code the first thing it will ask you is to share the letters in your rack as an input, one by one. You need to enter the tiles you have in your hand at the real board game you are playing. Once you enter all 7 letters, the code will ask you to define where you wish to locate the new word on the board. Please do keep in mind that this code only allows a maximum of 3 letter words and uses a 3x3 board. Once you choose the coordinates, the code will ask you to enter whichever letter is currently on the exact spot you chose on the board. Yes, for the code to function, you will need to choose one letter from the board that will be a part of your new word! Finally, assuming that all information inputted is correct, the code will pull the highest scored word from the lexicon for you to put on your board.

Congratulations, you are now on a winning streak on Scrabble!
